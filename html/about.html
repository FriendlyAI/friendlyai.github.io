            I am a software engineer with 5+ years of experience in computer science and a lifetime of experience in curiosity.
            <br><br>
            I have a passion not just for technology, but how it affects society and can change us. Behind every step of innovation, there is not just a "how?", but also a "why?". That is why I believe in security, simplicity, and sincerity in design (no JavaScript on this website!).
            <br><br>
            Beyond engineering, I am also interested in economics and law. As a dual CS and Economics major, I have the privilege of studying the behavior of both man and machine. One thing I've learned is that the future will need more than just engineers.
            <br><br>
            Keeping an open mind, I hope to make a difference where technology and society intersect, wherever that may end up taking me.
